Democratic General Artificial Intelligence
</font>

As the project name indicates, I hope this project
can help people without enough computing power,  
resources, or even network to access huge datasets.
I hope it will bring fun and inspiration to those
who want to share the thrill brought by AI.
We are in an ever greater Era that is calling for
everyone's involvement in AI development, not just
the few giant companies in the Silicon Valley.
However, we are definitely limited by the shortage of 
computation resources and big data. We can't train our
big models as fast as possible, and neither cannot 
get enough data for training.

The world best AI models, are trained with thousands of
GPU or TPU, and running out of huge electricity power
which costs over 10 million dollars that even a start-up
cannot afford.

Those best known models are trained with giant volume of
labeled and unlabeled data, which is also inaccessible
for ordinary individuals.

Few so-called open AI organizations are now charging
for fees, too.

We cannot wait any longer!

We deserve a better AI involvement!

WE ARE GETTING IT DEMOCRATIC RIGHT NOW!

For a real open AI, a general AI, and the most
important, a DEMOCRATIC AI!

Looking forward to your joining our project for
contributing democracy in AI ^_^
